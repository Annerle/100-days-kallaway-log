The log of my #100DaysOfCode (to keep separate from main repo and let others fork a clean version).

## Log

### R3D1 
Today I've started the 3rd API project from @freeCodeCamp -> http://glitch.com/edit/#!/collapse-url + started configuring mongodb
Planning to do more tomorrow: handling routes, etc. but will have to learn more about Mongo and DBs - feeling a bit lost

### R3D2
Worked on the URL Shortener App: http://glitch.com/edit/#!/collapse-url added mongodb connection, regex to determine if URL is valid. Today I honestly had the best time - for the first time ever I figured out how to work with a database (super basics). I don't know why I haven't done that before - I think I had fear of it or exaggerated the difficulty of it in my mind. And I can say that today is the day I've written something to a mongodb database for the first time ever :)

### R3D3
Finished the URL Shortener App https://collapse-url.glitch.me/ (doesn't look like much, but it works :) Feel free to test :) Here is the view into the code: http://glitch.com/edit/#!/collapse-url

### R3D4
Started working on the next @freeCodeCamp back-end project - Image Search Abstraction Layer https://pic-search.glitch.me/ . What it will do is just do a search and display image data it finds as JSON. Users will be able to view recent searches. Here is the view into the code: http://glitch.com/edit/#!/pic-search So far I connected mongodb to it, added some route handling.
Getting more and more comfortable with node, express and mongo :) They don't seem as intimidating as they once were. Got a bit sick, today not feeling great at all but didn't let that stop me today :) If I felt worse than that I'd skip a day and I think that's a valid reason to take a little break - health is important!
