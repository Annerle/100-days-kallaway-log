# #100DaysOfCode Log - Round 3 - Alexander Kallaway
The log of my #100DaysOfCode (to keep separate from main repo and let others fork a clean version).

Started on July 17, Monday, 2017.

## Log

### R3D1 
Today I've started the 3rd API project from @freeCodeCamp -> http://glitch.com/edit/#!/collapse-url + started configuring mongodb
Planning to do more tomorrow: handling routes, etc. but will have to learn more about Mongo and DBs - feeling a bit lost

### R3D2
Worked on the URL Shortener App: http://glitch.com/edit/#!/collapse-url added mongodb connection, regex to determine if URL is valid. Today I honestly had the best time - for the first time ever I figured out how to work with a database (super basics). I don't know why I haven't done that before - I think I had fear of it or exaggerated the difficulty of it in my mind. And I can say that today is the day I've written something to a mongodb database for the first time ever :)

### R3D3
Finished the URL Shortener App https://collapse-url.glitch.me/ (doesn't look like much, but it works :) Feel free to test :) Here is the view into the code: http://glitch.com/edit/#!/collapse-url

### R3D4
Started working on the next @freeCodeCamp back-end project - Image Search Abstraction Layer https://pic-search.glitch.me/ . What it will do is just do a search and display image data it finds as JSON. Users will be able to view recent searches. Here is the view into the code: http://glitch.com/edit/#!/pic-search So far I connected mongodb to it, added some route handling.
Getting more and more comfortable with node, express and mongo :) They don't seem as intimidating as they once were. Got a bit sick, today not feeling great at all but didn't let that stop me today :) If I felt worse than that I'd skip a day and I think that's a valid reason to take a little break - health is important!

### R3D5
Continued working on the Image Search App, at first had no idea what API to use - went with Google Custom Search API. The API requests seem to be working, but for now all the queries return 0 results #oops. You can see the code here: http://glitch.com/edit/#!/pic-search and try it out (though it's broken ðŸ¤– here: https://pic-search.glitch.me/

### R3D6
Finished the Image Search Abstraction Layer App on @freeCodeCamp https://pic-search.glitch.me/  feel free to try it out! I fixed the API settings issue, added database calls, formatted response JSONs. Excited to start the next project!

### R3D7
Built a little back-end app that allows user to upload a file and returns back its size - as part of @freeCodeCamp. Here is the link to the app: https://find-file-size.glitch.me/  and to the code: http://glitch.com/edit/#!/find-file-size . I thought I would be the most straight-forward project of the back-end ones, but I ended up sitting in frustration for most of today's session... :) After a lot of googling, I found the problem - I needed to have the name of the input to be the same as it was in the code dealing with that route. So when you work on this project: https://www.freecodecamp.com/challenges/file-metadata-microservice - keep it in mind ;) Might save you some time. I still need to come back to the first back end project and make a index page for it. After that - probably full-stack ðŸ˜¬

### R3D8
Set up the first Full Stack project on #freeCodeCamp - using Cloud9. There is a whole lot to figure out now :) If you've recently done any of the Full Stack projects on @freeCodeCamp - what did you use on top of ClementineJS? Did you do React on top of it? Or did you just stay with VanillaJS? Feeling a bit lost on how to best proceed #code

### R3D9
Continued to dig into the setup of the boilerplate for the full stack projects. Started work on displaying the poll list. Also found out what Mongoose does for MongoDB, created a Schema for a Poll in the database. Looking forward to accomplishing more tomorrow, as today I was more about understanding how it all fits together :)
